    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Overview: Increasing Operational Efficiency via Product & Automation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The GL Shine project was a critical strategic initiative aimed at revolutionizing our sales operation. The core challenge was a persistent disconnect between achieving enrollment targets and maintaining Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) compliance, exacerbated by inefficient legacy tools.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our mandate was to design and launch a sophisticated, unified platform—<strong>GL Shine v3</strong>—that would fundamentally empower our sales force, align compliance with performance, and deliver measurable business value.

    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        As the <strong>Lead UX Designer</strong>, my role was to diagnose the root cause of systemic failure—specifically, why two previous attempts had failed. 
        My primary objective was to halt the cycle of ineffective solutions by deeply understanding user behavior and procedural gaps, 
        establishing a robust, user-centered UX strategy that bridged the divide between sales autonomy and organizational compliance.

  <!-- Research & Insights -->
  <section class="mb-16">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">
        Deep-Dive: <span class="text-primary">Research & Foundational Insights</span>
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        During this phase, I conducted in-depth research with approximately 
        <strong>30 Learning Consultants (LCs)</strong>, along with <strong>4–5 Managers</strong> and 
        <strong>2–3 Business Unit (BU) Heads</strong>. 
        Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we gathered valuable insights that directly shaped 
        the UX direction for <strong>GL Shine v3</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">
        While specific data remains confidential under NDAs, the following themes summarize the most 
        impactful findings that guided the redesign:
    </p>

    <!-- Key Findings -->
    <div class="space-y-6 border-l-2 border-primary pl-6">
        <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-1">SOP Compliance Challenges</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400">LCs and managers struggled to consistently adhere to SOPs due to operational hurdles and conflicting priorities.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-1">Enrollment vs. SOP Focus</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400">A noticeable behavioral pattern showed that achieving enrollment targets often took precedence over maintaining SOP compliance.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-1">Lead Prioritisation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400">Lead tracking and prioritisation were primarily driven by instinct and manual spreadsheets, mixing engagement scores and personal judgment.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-1">Tool Integration Challenges</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400">Existing systems like LeadSquared lacked seamless integration with GL Shine, creating inefficiencies and inconsistent workflows.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-200 mb-1">UX & Workflow Improvements</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400">Stakeholders emphasized the need for a unified platform offering visibility, actionable insights, and simplified daily workflows for LCs, managers, and BU heads.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Highlight Insight -->
    <div class="mt-8 p-5 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 bg-gray-800/40">
        <p class="text-primary font-semibold mb-2">💡 Key Highlight</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The failure of previous versions stemmed from excessive rigidity that restricted 
        Learning Consultants’ (LCs) decision-making autonomy. The new design philosophy 
        focused on <strong>empowerment through guided flexibility</strong> — enabling informed 
        discretion while automating compliance where possible.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        These insights became the foundation of our new UX direction — a system that 
        aligns <strong>SOP compliance</strong> with <strong>enrollment goals</strong>, 
        enhances <strong>lead management efficiency</strong>, and 
        ultimately drives <strong>higher sales performance</strong> and user satisfaction.

    <p class="mb-4">
      Research revealed that Learning Consultants (LCs) primarily work on <strong>low-end laptops with basic trackpads</strong>, often avoiding mouse use. This shaped a scroll-optimized experience with minimal horizontal movement.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Due to their “<strong>sovereign posture</strong>” — a preference for viewing dense data on a single screen — the UI employed smaller fonts, compact layouts, and limited color use for visual efficiency.
    </p>

    <div class="my-6 flex justify-center">
      <img src="img/shine/1.jpg" alt="GL Shine Design Concept" class="rounded-xl shadow-lg max-w-full md:max-w-3xl border border-gray-700">

    <p class="mb-4">
      The existing tool, <strong>LeadSquared</strong>, posed major UX challenges — opening multiple tabs (up to 30 at times) during lead interactions. This created cognitive overload and fragmented workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this, an <strong>in-tab interaction model</strong> was designed, allowing multiple lead views in a single interface. LeadSquared was gradually phased out in <strong>two stages</strong>, ensuring seamless adoption and workflow continuity.

      Given the aggressive timeline, a live observation-based usability process replaced formal studies. Rapid iteration on real-time feedback helped identify friction points instantly.
    </p>
    <p>I wasn't able to conduct a formal usability study before the release. Instead, I, along with other product team members, observed numerous LCs (Learning Consultants) on the floor while they were using the product. This observation led to the identification of several areas for improvement, which we promptly addressed.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>Collaborated with training teams to embed learning modules within Shine.</li>
      <li>Realized <strong>₹50 crore annual savings</strong> through elimination of third-party tools.</li>
      <li>Boosted LC productivity by <strong>50–80%</strong> and achieved <strong>85% SOP compliance</strong>.</li>
      <li>Floor satisfaction reached an impressive <strong>4.65 / 5</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-8">This success instilled confidence in us to introduce further productivity enhancements, such as auto-dials, email management, SMS management, and auditing capabilities utilising AI technology. The project was deemed a huge success both from a business perspective and in terms of user satisfaction on the floor.
            <br/>
    👏 Thanks a ton, Team! Our journey from product conception to implementation was like riding a rollercoaster, full of twists and turns. Despite not having the luxury of a formal usability study, our 'on-the-floor' observations and quick tweaks worked wonders. Your dedication and adaptability saved us millions and boosted productivity beyond expectations. Cheers to our quirky and successful ride together!</p>
