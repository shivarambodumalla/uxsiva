      <h2 class="cs-section__title">Overview: Increasing Operational Efficiency via Product & Automation</h2>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        The GL Shine project was a critical strategic initiative aimed at revolutionizing our sales operation. The core
        challenge was a persistent disconnect between achieving enrollment targets and maintaining Standard Operating
        Procedure (SOP) compliance, exacerbated by inefficient legacy tools.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        Our mandate was to design and launch a sophisticated, unified platform, <strong>GL Shine v3</strong>, that would
        fundamentally empower our sales force, align compliance with performance, and deliver measurable business value.

      <h2 class="cs-section__title">My Leadership & <span class="cs-section__title--accent">Strategic Role</span></h2>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        As the <strong>Lead UX Designer</strong>, my role was to diagnose the root cause of systemic
        failure, specifically, why two previous attempts had failed.
        My primary objective was to halt the cycle of ineffective solutions by deeply understanding user behavior and
        procedural gaps, establishing a robust, user-centered UX strategy that bridged the divide between sales
        autonomy and organizational compliance.

    <!-- ===== RESEARCH & INSIGHTS ===== -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h2 class="cs-section__title">Deep-Dive: <span class="cs-section__title--accent">Research & Foundational
          Insights</span></h2>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        During this phase, I conducted in-depth research with approximately
        <strong>30 Learning Consultants (LCs)</strong>, along with <strong>4–5 Managers</strong> and
        <strong>2–3 Business Unit (BU) Heads</strong>.
        Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we gathered valuable insights that directly shaped
        the UX direction for <strong>GL Shine v3</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-section__text" style="color:var(--slate);">
        While specific data remains confidential under NDAs, the following themes summarize the most
        impactful findings that guided the redesign:

      <!-- Key Findings Timeline -->
      <div class="cs-timeline">
        <div class="cs-timeline__item">
          <h3 class="cs-card__title">SOP Compliance Challenges</h3>
          <p class="cs-card__text">LCs and managers struggled to consistently adhere to SOPs due to operational hurdles
            and conflicting priorities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-timeline__item">
          <h3 class="cs-card__title">Enrollment vs. SOP Focus</h3>
          <p class="cs-card__text">A noticeable behavioral pattern showed that achieving enrollment targets often took
            precedence over maintaining SOP compliance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-timeline__item">
          <h3 class="cs-card__title">Lead Prioritisation</h3>
          <p class="cs-card__text">Lead tracking and prioritisation were primarily driven by instinct and manual
            spreadsheets, mixing engagement scores and personal judgment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-timeline__item">
          <h3 class="cs-card__title">Tool Integration Challenges</h3>
          <p class="cs-card__text">Existing systems like LeadSquared lacked seamless integration with GL Shine, creating
            inefficiencies and inconsistent workflows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-timeline__item">
          <h3 class="cs-card__title">UX & Workflow Improvements</h3>
          <p class="cs-card__text">Stakeholders emphasized the need for a unified platform offering visibility,
            actionable insights, and simplified daily workflows for LCs, managers, and BU heads.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Key Highlight -->
      <div class="cs-card" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        <p style="color:var(--green);font-weight:600;margin-bottom:0.5rem;">💡 Key Highlight</p>
        <p class="cs-card__text">
          The failure of previous versions stemmed from excessive rigidity that restricted
          Learning Consultants' (LCs) decision-making autonomy. The new design philosophy
          focused on <strong>empowerment through guided flexibility</strong> — enabling informed
          discretion while automating compliance where possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="cs-section__text" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
        These insights became the foundation of our new UX direction: a system that
        aligns <strong>SOP compliance</strong> with <strong>enrollment goals</strong>,
        enhances <strong>lead management efficiency</strong>, and
        ultimately drives <strong>higher sales performance</strong> and user satisfaction.

        <h3 class="cs-card__title" style="color:var(--green);">Technical Constraints & Design Decisions</h3>
        <p class="cs-card__text">
          Research revealed that Learning Consultants (LCs) primarily work on <strong>low-end laptops with basic
            trackpads</strong>, often avoiding mouse use. This shaped a scroll-optimized experience with minimal
          horizontal movement.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-card__text">
          Due to their "<strong>sovereign posture</strong>" — a preference for viewing dense data on a single screen —
          the UI employed smaller fonts, compact layouts, and limited color use for visual efficiency.
        </p>

        <div style="margin:1.5rem 0;display:flex;justify-content:center;">

        </div>

        <p class="cs-card__text">
          The existing tool, <strong>LeadSquared</strong>, posed major UX challenges, opening multiple tabs (up to 30
          at times) during lead interactions. This created cognitive overload and fragmented workflows.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-card__text">
          To address this, an <strong>in-tab interaction model</strong> was designed, allowing multiple lead views in a
          single interface. LeadSquared was gradually phased out in <strong>two stages</strong>, ensuring seamless
          adoption and workflow continuity.

      </h2>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        Given the aggressive timeline, a live observation-based usability process replaced formal studies. Rapid
        iteration on real-time feedback helped identify friction points instantly.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        I wasn't able to conduct a formal usability study before the release. Instead, I, along with other product team
        members, observed numerous LCs (Learning Consultants) on the floor while they were using the product. This
        observation led to the identification of several areas for improvement, which we promptly addressed.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Collaborated with training teams to embed learning modules within Shine.</li>
        <li>Realized <strong>₹50 crore annual savings</strong> through elimination of third-party tools.</li>
        <li>Boosted LC productivity by <strong>50–80%</strong> and achieved <strong>85% SOP compliance</strong>.</li>
        <li>Floor satisfaction reached an impressive <strong>4.65 / 5</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cs-section__text" style="margin-top:2rem;">
        This success instilled confidence in us to introduce further productivity enhancements, such as
        auto-dials, email management, SMS management, and auditing capabilities utilising AI technology. The project was
        deemed a huge success both from a business perspective and in terms of user satisfaction on the floor.
        <br />
        👏 Thanks a ton, Team! Our journey from product conception to implementation was like riding a rollercoaster,
        full of twists and turns. Despite not having the luxury of a formal usability study, our 'on-the-floor'
        observations and quick tweaks worked wonders. Your dedication and adaptability saved us millions and boosted
        productivity beyond expectations. Cheers to our quirky and successful ride together!
