      <p>
        Olympus LMS is undergoing a revamp to enhance the learning experience for learners pursuing PG programs, including both non-programmers and programmers, with varying work experiences ranging from 0 to 25 years. The objective is to transform the LMS into a visually appealing, structured, responsive, and intuitive platform that offers a personalized and efficient learning journey.

    <div class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="h4 display-6 fw-bold">User Research </h2>
      <p>
        To grasp the system and how it operates, we engaged with key stakeholders overseeing the functions of AIML. This involved meetings with Vertical Heads, Learning Consultants, the Academic Operations Team, and Program Managers. 
        <br/>
        Through these stakeholder interviews, we gained insights into the company's mission of "Enabling Career Success in the Digital Economy" and its goal of making professionals proficient in their jobs and ready for the future. This mission is driving everyone towards the ambitious target of having five times more successful learners compared to previous years.

    <div class="my-5">
      <h4 class="display-6 fw-bold">Design and Implementation</h4>
      
      <p>
        A small team was formed comprising myself, two other developers, and a dedicated product manager for the design and implementation phase. Our approach involved collaborative brainstorming sessions to discuss user requirements, system functionalities, and technical constraints, leading to a clear roadmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        We began by creating wireframes and prototypes to visualise the user interface and gather stakeholder feedback, refining the user experience iteratively. Tasks were divided among team members based on expertise, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone contributed to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        During implementation, we coded, tested, and integrated components while conducting regular code reviews and testing cycles to maintain quality. Close collaboration within the team and with the product manager ensured an agile development process aligned with project goals, resulting in a successful outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        While addressing the primary concerns of stakeholders and Users, we have also introduced several new features. These include Excelerate, aimed at boosting career growth and job opportunities, as well as Hackathons for practicing skills and competing with peers within the batch and across organisations.

      <h4 class="display-6 fw-bold">Usability testing</h4>
      
      <p>
        Since this is a crucial feature for the organization, I recruited over 50 learners to test the platform and provide their feedback before the release.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the test, we defined 19 key tasks for the learners, and the usability test plan was structured as follows: We exposed the new platform to the learners and asked them to perform each task one by one. While they were completing the tasks, we closely monitored metrics such as task completion, time taken to complete each task, overall user experience, stress responses, questions asked, and number of mistakes made. The results were highly satisfactory, with minor hiccups that were quickly addressed. Additionally, we received subjective feedback from the learners, which we analyzed separately.
      </p>

    <div class="my-5">
      <h4 class="display-6 fw-bold">Delivery and post delivery Feedback</h4>
      
      <p>
        After receiving feedback from key stakeholders and analysing the usability test results, we gained confidence in the product's readiness. As a result, we decided to release it in a controlled manner, batch by batch. This approach was well-received by both learners and key stakeholders. The overall feedback for the product averaged around 4.78 out of 5, based on responses from approximately 1200 to 1500 learners who participated in the feedback process.
