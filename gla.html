          Deeper analysis revealed a powerful insight about mid-level professionals aged 25–35 —

      <p class="cs-section__text">
        User research revealed a pivotal behavioral pattern that redefined our design philosophy:
        learners preferred studying on mobile but practicing on laptops.
        This dual-device habit reflected a generation that valued flexibility without compromising depth.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-section__text">
        Recognizing this, we designed <strong>Great Learning Academy Pro</strong> —
        an AI-powered, subscription-based platform built for professionals aged 25–35,
        combining personalized guidance, adaptive learning paths, and measurable skill outcomes.
      </p>
